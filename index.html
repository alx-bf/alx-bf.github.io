  <p>Welcome to my website! In here, you'll find a lot of information about me, what I'm doing and my achievements so far.</p>
  
  <p>There are two ways to know about me in this website:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Read the <a href="http://alx-bf.github.io/about.html">about</a> section if you want to know about me <em>briefly</em>.</li>
    <li>Read the <a href="http://alx-bf.github.io/web-log.html">web log</a> section if you want to know about me in <em>detail</em>.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>The <a href="http://alx-bf.github.io/projects.html">projects</a> section is where you'll see my projects and contributions to the internet. The type of projects are mixed, but I'll see to it that they're organized appropriately.</p>
  
  <p>The design is inspired by <a href="http://catb.org/esr/">ESR's homepage</a>. I admit that I lack originality and creativity, but I intend to change that -- which you'll see in the web log soon. I used his design because of the simplicity and the way it's plain.</p>
  
  <p>This website is written using HTML and CSS, written by Alexander B. Falgui (me, of course) for myself and people interested to know me, written in Linux/GNU Debian 7 Wheezy and hosted using <a href="http://github.io/">Github Pages</a>.</p>
  
  <p>As the owner of the website and the alx-bf character, I'll allow you to use the site designs for your own benefits. In the projects section, you'll find that there are some you can modify and use in any way for your own benefit and some you can't. If you were to modify my projects, then I'd appreciate it if you credit me. You can't modify anything from the web log section because it's a personal section.</p>
